Day 1 28 Dec 14
Started the base code.
-A black rectangle in the upper left represents the player's base.
-A unit spawned in front of the rectangle can be directed via the mouse.
-Clicking the black rectangle at the bottom left spawns another unit, not yet controllable.

For tomorrow:
-Make the unit controllable
OR
-Get a progress meter where it takes time to create the unit
